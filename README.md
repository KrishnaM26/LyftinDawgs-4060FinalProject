### Contributions:
Working alongside a classmate, I fully implemented the front-end of this app:
  1. Created over 20 user cases for the use and implementation of the app.
  2. Designed an app prototype and user flow in Figma, fulfilling the requirements of the user cases.
  3. Implemented the full front-end natively in Android using Java.
